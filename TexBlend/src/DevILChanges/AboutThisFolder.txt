Devil Changes

This folder is not intended to be a full, buildable release of the DevIL library, but is intead intended to provide changed files that 
were used when building Caliente's Texture Blender. The code is licensed under the GPL 2.1 license, and is originally the intellectual
property of Denton Woods, copyright 2001-2008.
For the remainder of the library (version 1.7.8), please see http://openil.sourceforge.net/

The changes are small, for the most part, and focus on the library's handling of alpha blending
 src-IL
  il_states.h		-- added three defines for premultiplied alpha and bitmap matte application options
  il_states.c		-- modified to handle the new definitions above
  il_psd.c		-- modified to optionally strip photoshop's default white matte on transparency (premultiplied alpha).
  il_manip.c 		-- changed the colors of the default image generated by ilDefaultImage (to a white/gray checkerboard)
  il_devil.c		-- modified the iBlit function to use a more accurate alpha blending algorithm
  il_dds-save  		-- changed to support non compressed RGB and RGBA texture output

 src-ILUT
  il_win32.c		-- changed to apply a white or black matte when creating bitmaps from textures containing alpha channel
